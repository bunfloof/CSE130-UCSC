## Question at position 1

What are four conditions that must exist in order for a deadlock to occur?

Deadlocks are a condition in concurrent systems where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. According to Coffman et al. (1971), there are four conditions that must all hold for a deadlock to occur:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: This condition states that at least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode; only one process at a time can use the resource. If another process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource has been released.
2. **Hold and Wait** (Resource holding): This condition states that a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption**: This condition states that a resource can only be released voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task. It can not be forcefully taken away from the process.
4. **Circular Wait**: This condition states that there exists a set (a circular chain) of waiting processes such that each process in the set is waiting for a resource that is being held by the next process in the set.

These four conditions are necessary for a deadlock to occur. If even one of these conditions is not met, then a deadlock cannot occur. Consequently, to prevent deadlocks, systems can ensure that at least one of these conditions will never occur.

## Question at position 2

What are the four strategies to deal with deadlock?

1. Ignore the problem: This approach assumes that deadlocks are rare and the cost of handling them is higher than the impact of occasional deadlocks. The system does not take any specific measures to prevent or resolve deadlocks and simply hopes they will not occur or will resolve themselves.
2. Detection and recovery: The system allows deadlocks to occur but periodically checks for them. If deadlock is detected, the system takes action to recover from deadlock, such as terminating one or more processes involved in the deadlock or rolling back their actions to a previous point and releasing the resources held.
3. Dynamic avoidance by careful resource allocation: This approach involves analyzing the system's state and making decisions about resource allocation based on that information. By carefully managing resource allocation, the system avoids unsafe states that might lead to deadlocks. This requires processes to declare their maximum resource requirements in advance, which can be challenging in practice.
4. Prevention, by structurally negating one of the four required conditions: Deadlock prevention aims to ensure that at least one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait) is not met. By preventing any of these conditions from occurring, the system can ensure that deadlocks will not happen. For example, the system can require processes to request all needed resources at once, eliminating the hold and wait condition, or implement a resource hierarchy to avoid circular wait.

## Question at position 3

How might an operating system attack each of the four conditions necessary for deadlock in order to prevent the problem of deadlock?

An operating system can prevent deadlock by attacking each of the four conditions necessary for deadlock:

1. Mutual Exclusion: The operating system can attempt to minimize the use of non-shareable resources. For resources such as read-only files or memory, they can be made sharable using mechanisms like read/write locks. For other resources like printers or tapes, the operating system can use techniques like spooling or queues to virtualize and schedule access to the resources, allowing multiple processes to use them without direct mutual exclusion.
2. Hold and Wait: The operating system can enforce a policy like two-phase locking to avoid hold and wait. In phase one, a process must request all required resources at once before it starts executing. In phase two, if the process successfully acquires all resources, it can use and release them. If not, the process must release any resources it acquired and start over to prevent a process from holding some resources while waiting for others.
3. No Preemption: The operating system makes the scheduler aware of resource allocation and implement preemption policies. If a process requests a resource that can not be satisfied, the system can preempt the process, release all its resources, and schedule it only when all required resources can be allocated. The system can also preempt the process that holds requested resources to ensure that resources are not indefinitely held by processes that can not progress.
4. No Circular Wait: The operating system imposes an order on resource requests to prevent circular wait by assigning a unique ID to each resource. Processes must request resources in ascending order of their IDs. A variation of this method requires that a process can only request resources with an ID higher than the resources it already holds to ensure that no circular wait occurs, as processes follow a strict order in their resource requests.

## Question at position 4

What is the difference between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance?

1. Deadlock Prevention:
This approach aims to eliminate the possibility of a deadlock by ensuring that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait) is not met. The system guarantees that a deadlock cannot occur by structurally negating one of these conditions. Deadlock prevention is achieved through techniques like two-phase locking, preemption, resource ordering, or sharing resources whenever possible.
2. Deadlock Avoidance:
This approach focuses on carefully managing resource allocation to avoid deadlock situations without necessarily breaking any of the four necessary conditions. Deadlock avoidance relies on the system having knowledge of the resources each process may request in the future and making decisions based on this information to ensure that the system stays in a safe state, where every process can complete its execution without causing a deadlock. One well-known deadlock avoidance algorithm is the Banker's algorithm, which dynamically assesses resource allocation to determine if granting a resource request would lead to an unsafe state.

## Question at position 5

A computer has six tape drives, with n processes competing for them. Each process may need up to two drives. For which values of n is the system guaranteed to be deadlock free? Explain.

The maximum number of tape drives a process may need is 2. Even in the worst-case scenario, each process will hold 1 tape drive (assuming it already acquired one) and may still need one more. The system must have one tape drive available to allocate to prevent possible deadlock. The system has 6 tape drives in total. To guarantee that the system is deadlock-free, we must ensure that the number of processes (n) is such that there is always at least one tape drive that can be allocated even when each process is holding a tape drive.

The maximum number of processes that can run without risk of deadlock:

n ≤ (Total tape drives) - (Max number of tapes per process) + 1
n ≤ 6 - 2 + 1
n ≤ 5

Answer: n <= 5
